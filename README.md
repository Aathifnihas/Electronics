Malgadi is a for the students, by the student's venture. It is a non-profitable organization started by the college students to provide better quality electronic components at a reasonable rate. Along with this, we also organize workshops and seminars in colleges to impart technical knowledge to students.

We intend to develop this platform and extend its reach to as many students as possible, hence making technical education a bit more interesting. This is the platform which made us technically potent along with an experience of entrepreneurship.
